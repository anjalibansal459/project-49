                        <TD> I have been associated with whitehatjr for the past year and i have been 
                            learning coding . i have completed 49 classes and they are going very well . 
                            Coding not only helps to improve mental ability but also the logical ability . It helps an individual 
                            to understand things and then take actions that too after thinking .. He/she thinks 
                            about various ways to get something done . In a field like coding one must have patience 
                            and determination to learn and understand things
